### **ðŸŽ¯ Sprint Coordination:**
- **Each team** works on specialized branches with localized todo lists
- **All branches** sync with ultra-clean enterprise architecture
- **AI resources** distributed across teams for 10x development speed
- **September deadline** coordinated through integrated delivery pipeline

### **ðŸ”„ Synchronization Strategy:**
1. **Mirror architecture** across all branches
2. **Specialized todos** per team focus area  
3. **Regular integration** through main development branch
4. **Continuous delivery** pipeline for bootable ISO

### **âš¡ Development Acceleration:**
- **GitHub Copilot** active on all branches
- **Claude Desktop** with MCP integration
- **Kilo Code** for advanced context management
- **Professional tooling** configured identically
