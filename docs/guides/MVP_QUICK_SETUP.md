## ⚡ **INSTANT SETUP COMMANDS**

### **1. Install Rust Toolchain**

```bash

## Install Rust (if not already installed)

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source ~/.cargo/env

## Add kernel target

rustup target add x86_64-unknown-none
```text

## Add kernel target

rustup target add x86_64-unknown-none

```text

### **2. Install QEMU for Testing**

```bash
```bash

## Ubuntu/Debian

sudo apt update && sudo apt install qemu-system-x86

## macOS

brew install qemu

## Arch Linux

sudo pacman -S qemu
```text
## macOS

brew install qemu

## Arch Linux

sudo pacman -S qemu

```text

### **3. Build and Test Kernel**

```bash
```bash

## Source Rust environment

source ~/.cargo/env

## Build the kernel (must be built from kernel directory to avoid workspace crypto dependencies)

cd /home/diablorain/Syn_OS/src/kernel
cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-none

## Test in QEMU

./test_boot.sh
```text
## Build the kernel (must be built from kernel directory to avoid workspace crypto dependencies)

cd /home/diablorain/Syn_OS/src/kernel
cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-none

## Test in QEMU

./test_boot.sh

```text

### **4. Test Python AI Services**

```bash

```bash
cd /home/diablorain/Syn_OS

## Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements-consciousness.txt

## Test core services

python3 test_ai_consciousness_optimization.py
python3 test_core_services.py
```text

## Test core services

python3 test_ai_consciousness_optimization.py
python3 test_core_services.py

```text

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Kernel Build Issues**

#### **Problem: "cargo: command not found"**

```bash
### **Kernel Build Issues**

#### **Problem: "cargo: command not found"**

```bash

## Solution: Source Rust environment

source ~/.cargo/env

## Or permanently add to PATH:

echo 'source ~/.cargo/env' >> ~/.bashrc
```text
## Or permanently add to PATH:

echo 'source ~/.cargo/env' >> ~/.bashrc

```text

#### **Problem: "getrandom target not supported"**

```bash
```bash

## Solution: Build from kernel directory (not workspace root)

cd src/kernel
cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-none
```text

```text

#### **Problem: "Target x86_64-unknown-none not found"**

```bash
```bash

## Solution: Install the target

rustup target add x86_64-unknown-none
```text

```text

### **QEMU Issues**

#### **Problem: "qemu-system-x86_64 not found"**

```bash
```bash

## Ubuntu/Debian:

sudo apt install qemu-system-x86

## Verify installation:

which qemu-system-x86_64
```text
## Verify installation:

which qemu-system-x86_64
