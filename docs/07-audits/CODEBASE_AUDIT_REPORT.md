### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

#### 1. **Code Optimization Opportunities**

**Memory Management Enhancement:**

```rust
// Current: Basic allocation
pub fn standard_allocate(layout: Layout) -> Result<NonNull<u8>, AllocError> {
    // Implementation uses linked list allocator fallback
}

// Recommended: Add memory pooling for AI operations
pub struct MemoryPool {
    pools: BTreeMap<usize, spin::Mutex<alloc::vec::Vec<NonNull<u8>>>>,
    // Pool allocation strategy for frequent AI tensor operations
}
```

**Async Performance:**

-   Current NATS client uses basic async patterns
-   **Recommendation**: Implement connection pooling and batch operations for high-throughput scenarios

**Cryptographic Operations:**

-   Current encryption service creates new instances per operation
-   **Recommendation**: Implement session-based encryption with key rotation

#### 2. **Build System Enhancements**

**Parallel Processing:**

-   Current build script processes stages sequentially
-   **Recommendation**: Add parallel package installation and AI library downloads

**Caching Strategy:**

-   Build system lacks incremental compilation caching
-   **Recommendation**: Implement artifact caching for faster rebuilds

#### 3. **Security Hardening**

**Input Validation:**

```rust
// Current: Basic validation in security module
pub fn validate_input(input: &str) -> Result<(), ValidationError> {
    // Basic checks only
}

// Recommended: Add comprehensive input sanitization
pub fn validate_and_sanitize(input: &str) -> Result<String, ValidationError> {
    // Multi-layer validation with sanitization
}
```

**Audit Logging:**

-   Current audit system is functional but could be enhanced
-   **Recommendation**: Add structured logging with compliance formats (CEF, LEEF)
