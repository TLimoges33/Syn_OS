## 🎬 Next Steps After Build

### 1. Test ISO in VM

```bash
# Using QEMU
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 4096 -cdrom build/synos-v1.0/SynOS-v1.0.0-*.iso -boot d
```

### 2. Write to USB Drive

```bash
# Find USB device
lsblk

# Write ISO (replace sdX with your USB device)
sudo dd if=build/synos-v1.0/SynOS-v1.0.0-*.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress conv=fsync
```

### 3. Boot and Test

-   Test live boot
-   Test desktop environment switching
-   Launch demo/welcome screen
-   Test GitHub integration links
-   Test Calamares installer (in VM only!)
-   Verify 500+ tools are accessible

### 4. Release

Once tested:

```bash
# Create release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "SynOS v1.0.0 Neural Genesis Release"
git push origin v1.0.0

# Upload ISO to GitHub Releases
# Include MD5 and SHA256 checksums
```

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If build fails:

1. Check build log: `tail -100 build/synos-v1.0/build.log`
2. Verify disk space: `df -h`
3. Check missing packages: Run preflight checks manually
4. Clean and retry: `sudo rm -rf build/synos-v1.0 && sudo ./scripts/build/...`

### If ISO doesn't boot:

1. Verify BIOS vs UEFI boot mode
2. Check ISO integrity: Compare checksums
3. Test in different VM: Try VirtualBox, VMware, QEMU
4. Check USB write: Verify USB is not corrupted
