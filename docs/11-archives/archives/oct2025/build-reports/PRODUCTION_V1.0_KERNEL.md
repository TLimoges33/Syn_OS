## 🚀 Boot Process

### GRUB Menu (Option 4):
```
SynOS Native Kernel (Experimental - Custom Rust Kernel)
    multiboot2 /live/synos-kernel.bin
```

### What Happens:
1. **GRUB loads kernel** (73KB binary)
2. **Kernel initializes** (bare-metal, no Linux underneath)
3. **Memory manager starts** (paging, heap)
4. **Interrupt handlers install** (IDT setup)
5. **Device drivers load** (keyboard, disk, network)
6. **Process scheduler starts** (first userspace process)
7. **Graphics system initializes** (framebuffer)
8. **AI consciousness activates** (kernel-level awareness)
9. **Shell or init starts** (userspace)

This is **NOT running on Linux** - this IS the operating system!

- ✅ Security (access control, threat detection, audit)

### In Progress (85%):
- ⚠️ Network stack (TCP state machine needs completion)
  - TCP/UDP/ICMP handlers: ✅ Done
  - IP routing: ✅ Done
  - Full TCP state machine: 🔄 In progress
  - Socket operations: 🔄 Needs completion
