## 📝 Next Steps

### Step 1: Build ISO (30-40 min)
```bash
cd linux-distribution/SynOS-Linux-Builder
sudo lb clean --purge
sudo lb build
```

### Step 2: Finalize (1 min)
```bash
cd /home/diablorain/Syn_OS
sudo mv linux-distribution/SynOS-Linux-Builder/live-image-amd64.hybrid.iso \
    build/synos-v1.0-final.iso
sudo chown diablorain:diablorain build/synos-v1.0-final.iso
cd build
sha256sum synos-v1.0-final.iso > synos-v1.0-final.iso.sha256
md5sum synos-v1.0-final.iso > synos-v1.0-final.iso.md5
```

### Step 3: Test (15 min)
```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom build/synos-v1.0-final.iso -m 4G -enable-kvm
```

**Total Time to v1.0:** ~45-55 minutes
