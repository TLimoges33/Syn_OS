# 🍴 Create Your Own Operating System - Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 Overview

Based on our comprehensive ParrotOS 6.4 analysis (3,561 packages with 500+ security tools), you can now create your own custom operating system fork that combines:

- **ParrotOS Security Excellence** - Complete security tool collection
- **SynOS AI Consciousness** - Educational AI system
- **Custom Branding** - Your unique identity
- **Educational Framework** - Structured learning progression

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Choose Your OS Name
Pick a unique name for your operating system (examples: `CyberSecOS`, `EduSecLinux`, `MySecurityOS`)

### Step 2: Run the Fork Setup
```bash
# Run the automated setup script
/home/diablorain/Syn_OS/scripts/setup-parrot-fork.sh YourOSName

# Example:
/home/diablorain/Syn_OS/scripts/setup-parrot-fork.sh CyberSecOS
```

### Step 3: Customize Your Fork
```bash
# Navigate to your new fork
cd ~/YourOSName

# Customize the build configuration
nano build/config/build.conf

# Modify branding and artwork
nano source/artwork/branding.conf

# Add/remove security tools
nano packages/security-tools.list
```

### Step 4: Build Your ISO
```bash
# Install build dependencies (one-time setup)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install live-build debootstrap xorriso

# Build your custom OS
cd ~/YourOSName
sudo build/scripts/build-fork.sh
```

### Step 5: Test Your OS
```bash
# Your ISO will be in iso/output/
# Test with QEMU
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 4096 -cdrom iso/output/*.iso

# Or create bootable USB
sudo dd if=iso/output/*.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
```
