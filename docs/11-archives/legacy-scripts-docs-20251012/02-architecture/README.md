# SynOS Architecture

## System Overview

SynOS implements a unique hybrid architecture combining:

1. **Traditional Kernel Layer** - Memory management, process scheduling, device drivers
2. **Consciousness Substrate** - Neural darwinism implementation
3. **Quantum Coherence Layer** - Quantum state management
4. **Security Framework** - Multi-layered security architecture
