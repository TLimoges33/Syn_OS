# âœ… SynOS Implementation Checklist

Quick reference for what's been completed and what's next.

## ðŸŽ¯ COMPLETED TODAY

### Codebase Cleanup

-   [x] Removed 401MB archive directory
-   [x] Removed 4.5GB custom-os-development duplicate
-   [x] Removed 7 legacy files
-   [x] Consolidated 17 â†’ 9 consciousness implementations
-   [x] Fixed lib.rs module organization
-   [x] Fixed main.rs to use lib.rs exports
-   [x] Updated Cargo.toml workspace excludes
-   [x] Created unified build script

**Result**: ~4.9GB disk space freed, cleaner codebase

### Security Enhancements

-   [x] Created SECURITY.md with vulnerability disclosure policy
-   [x] Created threat model (THREAT_MODEL.md)
-   [x] Created exploit scenarios documentation
-   [x] Setup fuzzing infrastructure (Cargo.toml + 2 fuzz targets)
-   [x] Created security unit test template
-   [x] Documented 10x developer recommendations

## ðŸ“‹ TODO: CRITICAL PRIORITY

### This Week

-   [ ] Run fuzzing suite and document findings

    ```bash
    cd fuzz && cargo fuzz run fuzz_syscall -- -max_total_time=3600
    ```

-   [ ] Add unit tests to security modules

    ```bash
    # Add `mod tests;` to src/kernel/src/security/mod.rs
    cargo test --lib security
    ```

-   [ ] Create one CTF challenge for educational platform
-   [ ] Write one blog post about the project
-   [ ] Record 5-minute demo video

### Next 2 Weeks

-   [ ] Add performance benchmarks with Criterion
-   [ ] Setup continuous fuzzing in CI
-   [ ] Create security metrics dashboard script
-   [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for security checks
-   [ ] Add README badges (build status, coverage)

## ðŸŽ“ PORTFOLIO ITEMS

### To Create

-   [ ] Demo video (10 minutes)
-   [ ] 3-5 blog posts
-   [ ] Professional pentest report
-   [ ] Architecture diagrams
-   [ ] 3+ CVE-style vulnerability reports

### To Measure

-   [ ] Code coverage (target: 80%+)
-   [ ] Unsafe code percentage (target: <5%)
-   [ ] Number of security tests (target: 100+)
-   [ ] Fuzz crashes found and fixed

## ðŸš€ QUICK COMMANDS

### Run Security Checks

```bash
# Fuzzing
cd fuzz && cargo fuzz run fuzz_syscall

# Tests
cargo test --all-features

# Static analysis
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo audit

# Coverage
cargo tarpaulin --out Html
```

### Build & Test

```bash
# Clean build
cargo clean && cargo check

# Build ISO
cd linux-distribution/SynOS-Linux-Builder/scripts
./build-synos.sh --variant desktop --desktop mate
```
