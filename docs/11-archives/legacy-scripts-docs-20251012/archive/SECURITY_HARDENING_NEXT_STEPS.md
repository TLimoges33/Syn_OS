# Security Hardening: Next Steps for SynapticOS Codespace

## 1. Secrets Management
- [ ] Add `.env.example` and document all required secrets as environment variables.
- [ ] Add `.env` to `.gitignore` (if not already present).
- [ ] Audit all scripts for hardcoded secrets or credentials.
- [ ] Document use of secret managers (e.g., GitHub Codespaces secrets, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault).

## 2. Dependency Pinning & Audit Tooling
- [ ] Ensure all `requirements.txt` and `Pipfile.lock` are up to date and committed.
- [ ] Add `cargo-audit` and `safety` checks to CI pipeline.
- [ ] Document how to run `cargo audit`, `safety check`, and `npm audit`.

## 3. Automated Security Scans
- [ ] Add Bandit (Python), Semgrep, and Trivy to CI pipeline.
- [ ] Document how to run static analysis locally and in CI.

## 4. Code Signing Instructions
- [ ] Document how to sign critical scripts and binaries (e.g., using GPG or Sigstore).
- [ ] Add a `CODE_SIGNING.md` guide.

## 5. Access Controls & Review Policies
- [ ] Document branch protection and code review requirements.
- [ ] Restrict write access to main branches.
- [ ] Require reviews for all merges to `master`.

## 6. Regular Audit Checklist
- [ ] Add `AUDIT_CHECKLIST.md` with periodic review steps for secrets, dependencies, and permissions.
