---

## üìã REMAINING WORK (Phase 2-3)

### High Priority Files (Need Update)

**Location:** `docs/06-project-status/recent/`

1. **AI_RUNTIME_COMPLETION_REPORT.md**
   - Issue: Claims "100% CODE COMPLETE" for AI runtime
   - Reality: Infrastructure only, no ML engines installed
   - Action: Update to reflect 15% complete status

2. **AI_RUNTIME_STATUS.md**
   - Issue: Claims "100% COMPLETE - All stubs removed"
   - Reality: FFI bindings exist, but no TFLite/ONNX/ChromaDB installed
   - Action: Clarify infrastructure vs working implementation

3. **PRE_BUILD_CHECKLIST_v1.0.md**
   - Issue: Lists "AI Runtime Libraries - 100% complete"
   - Reality: Not installed
   - Action: Update checklist with honest status

4. **COMPLETE-INTEGRATION-REPORT.md**
   - Issue: Claims "Production Readiness 100%"
   - Reality: Foundation only
   - Action: Update to reflect foundation vs AI kernel

5. **BUILD_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md**
   - Issue: "Code: 100% COMPLETE"
   - Reality: AI kernel 0% implemented
   - Action: Update with realistic assessment

### Medium Priority (Archives - October 2025)

**Location:** `docs/06-project-status/archives/oct2025/`

These files are archived and less critical, but should eventually be updated or clearly marked as "historical" with disclaimers:

- `SESSION_3_COMPLETION.md` - Claims "100% COMPLETE"
- `100_PERCENT_VERIFICATION.md` - False verification
- `COMPLETE_100_PERCENT_AUDIT.md` - Incorrect audit
- `CRITICAL_COMPONENTS_COMPLETE.md` - Overclaimed completion
- `WIKI_100_PERCENT_COMPLETE.md` - Wiki completion claims

**Recommendation:** Add header to archive files: "HISTORICAL DOCUMENT - October 2025 - Status reports from before AI kernel roadmap clarification"

### Low Priority (Build Documentation)

**Location:** `docs/03-build/`

Build documentation is mostly accurate about the foundation (ParrotOS, tools, ISO building), but some files mention AI features as if they're complete:

- `COMPLETE_ISO_BUILD_SUMMARY.md`
- `QUICK_BUILD_REFERENCE.md`
- `BUILD_SYSTEM_V2.2_COMPLETE.md`

**Action:** Review and clarify that build system is complete for foundation, AI kernel in development

---

## üü¢ WIKI STATUS (Minimal Issues)

**Location:** `docs/12-wiki/` (was incorrectly referenced as docs/10-wiki/)

### Audit Results
- **Total files:** 46 markdown files
- **Issues found:** Minimal
- **Status:** Generally accurate

### Wiki Findings

**Home.md & README.md:**
- References "v1.0 Red Phoenix RELEASED" - ‚úÖ TRUE (for foundation)
- Mentions "500+ security tools" - ‚úÖ TRUE
- States "Production Ready" - ‚úÖ TRUE (for foundation)
- Does NOT falsely claim AI kernel is complete

**Internal/Restricted Wiki Files:**
- Checked: `AI-Consciousness-Engine.md`, `Custom-Kernel.md`
- No obvious false "100% complete" claims found
- Appear to be more theoretical/roadmap focused

### Wiki Recommendation
**No immediate action needed.** Wiki documentation is reasonable and doesn't make the same false claims as status reports. User requested wiki be treated separately and fact-checked without consolidation - this is appropriate.

## üí¨ TRUST COMMITMENT GOING FORWARD

### New Documentation Standards

**‚úÖ DO:**
- State exact percentage complete with evidence
- Separate "infrastructure exists" from "feature works"
- Clearly mark research/educational vs production code
- Provide realistic timelines
- Update docs when status changes
- Mark historical docs with "ARCHIVED" headers

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Claim "100% complete" for frameworks without implementation
- Say "production ready" for code that doesn't run
- Conflate code existence with functionality
- Make optimistic projections without disclaimers
- Hide gaps or limitations

### Monthly Status Updates

Moving forward, we commit to:
1. **Monthly PROJECT_STATUS.md updates** with honest progress
2. **Clear versioning** for documentation (v1.0-foundation, v1.1-ai-kernel, etc.)
3. **Changelog** tracking all significant doc changes
4. **Review process** before claiming any feature "complete"
5. **External validation** where possible (user testing, peer review)

## üìö KEY TRUTHS (Ground Reality)

### What Works TODAY (October 28, 2025)

**‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY:**
1. ParrotOS 6.4 Linux distribution (Debian 12 Bookworm)
2. 500+ security tools (nmap, metasploit, burp, wireshark, john, etc.)
3. Build system (2,775-line script, builds 12-15GB ISO)
4. Red Phoenix branding (logos, themes, boot screens)
5. AI daemon binaries (compiled, 2.5MB total)
6. Documentation framework (734 files, needs cleanup)

### What's In Development (0-15% Complete)

**üöß IN DEVELOPMENT:**
1. AI-Enhanced Linux Kernel - 0% (6-month roadmap defined)
2. AI Runtime Integration - 15% (infrastructure, no ML engines)
3. Rust Research Kernel - Educational only (74K lines, not production)

### What We're Building (Next 6 Months)

**üìã ROADMAP (April 2026 Target):**
1. Phase 1: Linux kernel source setup (Weeks 1-2)
2. Phase 2: AI-aware syscalls (Weeks 3-6)
3. Phase 3: eBPF telemetry (Weeks 7-10)
4. Phase 4: Consciousness-aware scheduler (Weeks 11-14)
5. Phase 5: AI runtime integration (Weeks 15-20)
