[profile.release]
opt-level = 3           # Maximum optimization
lto = "fat"            # Link-time optimization
codegen-units = 1      # Single codegen unit
panic = "abort"        # Smaller binary, faster execution
strip = true           # Strip debug symbols
overflow-checks = false
incremental = false    # ← NEW: Better optimization
rpath = false          # ← NEW: Security enhancement
