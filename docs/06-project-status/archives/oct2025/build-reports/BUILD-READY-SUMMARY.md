## ⚠️ Action Required Before Build

### CRITICAL: Run Build Cleanup

The `build/` directory contains **42GB of old artifacts** that should be cleaned:

```bash
cd /home/diablorain/Syn_OS/scripts/build
sudo ./pre-build-cleanup.sh
```

This will:

-   Remove old ISO build directories (iso-analysis, bulletproof-iso, etc.)
-   Free up ~35-40GB of disk space
-   Create clean build structure for v1.0.0
-   Verify no sensitive files are staged for commit

---

## 🎯 Build Execution (After Cleanup)

Once cleanup is complete:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to build scripts
cd /home/diablorain/Syn_OS/scripts/build

# 2. Create build log directory
mkdir -p ../../logs/builds

# 3. Execute the build!
sudo ./build-synos-ultimate-iso.sh 2>&1 | tee ../../logs/builds/v1.0.0-build-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log
```

**Expected Results:**

-   ISO: `synos-v1.0.0-ultimate.iso`
-   Size: 12-15GB
-   Build Time: 30-60 minutes
-   Location: `/home/diablorain/Syn_OS/build/synos-ultimate/`
