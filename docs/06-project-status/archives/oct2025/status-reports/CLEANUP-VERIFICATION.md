## 🔍 WHAT WAS ACTUALLY DELETED?

### Analysis of Deleted Content

#### 1. build/iso-analysis/ (21GB)

**Type:** ISO analysis artifacts from Oct 6
**Contents:**

-   `filesystem-7z.squashfs` (5.1GB) - Compressed filesystem extract
-   `filesystem.squashfs` (840MB) - Standard filesystem extract
-   `check/` directory - Full extracted Linux filesystem
-   Rebranding scripts and assets
-   Analysis documentation

**Critical?** ❌ NO

-   Analysis was completed
-   Source ISO still exists as final build
-   Extraction artifacts, not source files
-   Can be recreated by extracting ISO again if needed

#### 2. build/synos-iso/ (12GB)

**Type:** In-progress debootstrap build
**Contents:**

-   `chroot/` directory (12GB) - Partial Linux system
-   `iso/` directory (empty) - No ISO created yet
-   Debootstrap filesystem with etc/, boot/, dev/, etc.

**Critical?** ❌ NO

-   Build was never completed (iso/ directory empty)
-   Was an in-progress/failed build attempt
-   Can be recreated by running build script
-   No unique data, just standard packages

#### 3. Old ISOs and Artifacts

-   `SynOS-Bulletproof-v1.0-20251007-130824.iso` (415MB) - Earlier test from same day
-   `build/syn_os.iso` (22MB) - Very old from Sep 21
-   Various small directories (<10MB each)

**Critical?** ❌ NO

-   Superseded by latest successful build
-   Latest ISO (9.4GB from 15:27) is preserved
-   Old test builds not needed
