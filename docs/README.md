## Conventions

- All major documentation is stored here, not in the repo root.
- Each subdirectory must have a `README.md` summarizing its contents.
- Numbered folders (e.g., `01-`, `02-`) are used for top-level clarity and should be used consistently.
- Redundant or outdated documents should be archived or consolidated for clarity.

For more details, see each subfolder's `README.md`.
