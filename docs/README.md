# Syn_OS Documentation

This directory contains all official documentation for the Syn_OS project. Documentation is organized into clearly
numbered and named subfolders for easy navigation and consistency. Each subfolder contains a `README.md` describing its
contents and purpose.

## Structure

- `01-overview/` ‚Äî Project vision, system overview, and onboarding
- `02-architecture/` ‚Äî Architecture guides and implementation details
- `05-api-reference/` ‚Äî API documentation (reserved for future use)
- `07-archive/` and `08-archive/` ‚Äî Legacy and archived documents
- `academic/` ‚Äî Academic partnerships and research
- `architecture/` ‚Äî Roadmaps and architecture plans
- `configuration/` ‚Äî Configuration recommendations
- `development/` ‚Äî Development quick starts and guides
- `guides/` ‚Äî General guides and security
- `implementation/` ‚Äî Implementation reports and summaries
- `project-management/` ‚Äî Project management, task tracking, and organization
- `reports/` ‚Äî Codebase audits, issue resolution, and completion reports
- `research/` ‚Äî Research plans, frameworks, and technical explorations
- `roadmaps/` ‚Äî Roadmaps and strategic plans
- `specifications/` ‚Äî Specifications and enhancement plans

## Conventions

- All major documentation is stored here, not in the repo root.
- Each subdirectory must have a `README.md` summarizing its contents.
- Numbered folders (e.g., `01-`, `02-`) are used for top-level clarity and should be used consistently.
- Redundant or outdated documents should be archived or consolidated for clarity.

For more details, see each subfolder's `README.md`.
