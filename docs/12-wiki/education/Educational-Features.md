=== Tutorial: Network Scanning Basics ===

Step 1/5: Understanding Port Scanning
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

What is a port?
A port is like a door on a computer. Different services
listen on different ports (e.g., HTTP on port 80).

Task: Use nmap to scan a single port on localhost.

Command template: nmap -p <port> <target>

Try it: nmap -p 80 localhost

[Your turn] > nmap -p 80 localhost

‚úì Correct! Port 80 is open and running nginx.

[AI Tutor]: Great job! Now let's try scanning multiple ports...
