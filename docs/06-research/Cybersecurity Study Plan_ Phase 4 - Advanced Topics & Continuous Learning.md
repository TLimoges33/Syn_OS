   * **Platform Specifics:** Learn the key security services for at least one major provider (e.g., AWS: IAM, Security Groups, VPC, CloudTrail, GuardDuty, KMS; Azure: Azure AD, NSGs, VNet, Azure Monitor, Key Vault).  
   * **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM):** Understand tools and techniques for assessing cloud configurations.  
   * *Resource Focus:* Vendor-specific certifications (AWS Certified Security \- Specialty, Azure Security Engineer Associate AZ-500, Google Professional Cloud Security Engineer).  
2. **Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR):**  
   * **Incident Response (IR) Lifecycle:** Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned (PICERL).  
   * **Digital Forensics Principles:** Evidence handling (chain of custody), disk imaging, memory analysis, log analysis, timeline creation.  
   * **Tool Introduction (Autopsy, Encase):** Understand the purpose of forensic suites for analyzing disk images and artifacts.  
   * **Basic Analysis:** Learn to identify key artifacts (e.g., browser history, registry keys, event logs, file metadata).  
3. **AI in Cybersecurity:**  
   * **Use Cases:**  
     * **Defense:** Enhanced threat detection (malware, anomalies), automated alert triage, vulnerability scanning assistance, phishing detection (e.g., Abnormal Security).  
     * **Offense:** Automating pentesting tasks (recon, vulnerability identification \- e.g., PentestGPT, Burp AI), exploit generation assistance.  
   * **Risks & Challenges:** Adversarial AI (evading detection), potential for misuse by attackers, data privacy concerns, prompt injection, ethical dilemmas, accuracy/false positives.  
   * **Frameworks & Guidelines:**  
     * **OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications:** Understand specific risks like prompt injection, data leakage, insecure output handling.  
     * **MITRE ATLAS:** Adversarial tactics and techniques against AI systems.  
     * **NIST AI Risk Management Framework (RMF):** Governance framework for managing AI risks.  
   * **Tool Awareness:** Be aware of emerging tools like PentestGPT, Agentic Radar, Burp AI, and platforms using AI for compliance (as mentioned in source doc).  
4. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security:**  
   * **Tools:** Understand the basics of Terraform (HashiCorp) and Ansible (Red Hat) for defining and managing infrastructure.  
   * **Security Concepts:** Secure coding practices for IaC templates, secrets management (avoiding hardcoded credentials), scanning templates for misconfigurations (e.g., using tfsec, checkov).  
   * **Automation Benefits & Risks:** Understand how IaC improves consistency but can also rapidly deploy insecure configurations if not checked.

#### **Tool Guides & How to Use Them:**

1. **Cloud Platforms (AWS/Azure/GCP Console & CLI):**  
   * **Approach:** Focus on security-related services. Create a free tier account.  
   * **Practice:**  
     * Configure IAM users, groups, and roles with minimal privileges.  
     * Set up Network Security Groups (NSGs) or Security Groups to allow specific traffic (e.g., SSH/HTTP) to a VM.  
     * Enable logging services (CloudTrail/Azure Monitor) and review basic logs.  
     * Explore security dashboard features (AWS Security Hub, Azure Security Center/Defender for Cloud).  
   * **Resources:** Official documentation from [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/security/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/security/), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/security). Free labs and tutorials provided by the vendors (AWS Skill Builder, Microsoft Learn, Google Cloud Training).  
2. **Digital Forensics Tools (Autopsy):**  
   * **Installation:** Download Autopsy (free, open-source) from [autopsy.com](https://www.autopsy.com/).  
   * **Basic Workflow:**  
     * Create a New Case.  
     * Add a Data Source (load a disk image \- find sample images online for practice, e.g., from [Digital Corpora](https://digitalcorpora.org/)).  
     * Configure and run Ingest Modules (e.g., Recent Activity, Hash Lookup, Keyword Search).  
     * Explore the interface: File browser, Timeline view, Keyword search results, Exif data.  
   * **Goal:** Understand the basic process of analyzing a disk image, not become an expert forensic analyst immediately.  
   * **Resources:** [Autopsy Documentation & Training](https://www.autopsy.com/support/training/).  
3. **AI Tools (Conceptual Understanding):**  
   * **Approach:** Focus on *what* these tools aim to do rather than deep usage, as the field is evolving rapidly.  
   * **PentestGPT/Burp AI:** Understand they assist human testers by automating recon, suggesting exploits, or summarizing findings. Read their documentation or blog posts.  
   * **Agentic Radar:** Understand its purpose â€“ scanning AI workflow code for vulnerabilities in dependencies or LLM interactions.  
   * **Ethical Use:** Always consider permissions, data privacy, and potential for misuse when exploring AI security tools.  
4. **IaC Tools (Terraform/Ansible):**  
   * **Installation:** Follow official guides for [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) and [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).
