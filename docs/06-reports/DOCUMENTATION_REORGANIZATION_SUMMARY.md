   - Consolidated duplicate files
   - Clean docs root directory with only organized subdirectories

3. **Better Navigation**

   - Clear categorization by purpose
   - Updated index files with proper references
   - Comprehensive documentation structure

4. **Enhanced Discoverability**
   - Setup guides are linked from development workflows
   - Configuration guides are accessible from reference section
   - Reports are properly categorized and indexed
