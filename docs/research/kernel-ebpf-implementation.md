# SynapticOS eBPF Implementation Guide

> **Source**: Migrated from `TLimoges33/SynapticOS:src/kernel/ebpf/README.md`  
> **Purpose**: Essential documentation for kernel-level consciousness integration  
> **Relevance**: CRITICAL for Phase 1 & 2 of real OS development

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidance for implementing eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) programs that provide kernel-level data collection for the consciousness-integrated operating system.

## Architecture Overview

eBPF programs run in kernel space and provide real-time monitoring of:

- Network traffic and security events
- Process creation, execution, and behavior
- Memory operations and access patterns
- System call activity

The collected data is sent to the consciousness engine for AI-driven analysis and security decision-making.

## Program Categories

### Network Monitoring

- `network/network_monitor.c` - Monitors network packets, detects suspicious patterns, and provides traffic analysis
- `network/network_consciousness.c` - Advanced network behavior analysis with consciousness integration

### Process Monitoring

- `process/process_monitor.c` - Tracks process lifecycle, execution patterns, and detects suspicious behavior

### Memory Monitoring

- `memory/memory_consciousness.c` - Monitors memory allocation and access patterns

### System Call Monitoring

- `syscall_monitor.c` - Tracks system call usage and patterns

## Building eBPF Programs

### Prerequisites

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
sudo make install-deps
```

This will install:

- clang and LLVM
- libbpf development files
- Linux kernel headers
- bpftool

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build all eBPF programs
make all

# Build specific categories
make network    # Network monitoring programs
make process    # Process monitoring programs
make memory     # Memory monitoring programs
make syscall    # System call monitoring programs

# Generate skeleton headers for userspace
make skeletons

# Verify programs can load
sudo make verify

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

## Integration with Consciousness Engine

The eBPF programs communicate with the consciousness engine through:

1. **Ring Buffers** - High-performance event streaming
2. **Hash Maps** - Shared state and statistics
3. **Perf Events** - Real-time notifications

### Data Flow Architecture

```

```

## Security Features Implementation

### Network Monitor Capabilities

- Port scan detection
- SYN flood detection
- Suspicious IP tracking
- Automatic packet dropping for high-risk traffic

### Process Monitor Capabilities

- Process injection detection
- Fork bomb prevention
- Ptrace monitoring
- Executable memory tracking

## Performance Considerations

- All programs use `__always_inline` for critical paths
- Per-CPU maps where applicable
- Minimal overhead design
- Early filtering to reduce data volume

## Testing Framework

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Unit tests for eBPF programs
make test

# Integration tests with consciousness engine
cd ../consciousness/tests
python test_ebpf_integration.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing headers**: Install kernel headers matching your kernel version
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
   ```

2. **Permission denied**: eBPF programs require CAP_BPF or root
   ```bash
   sudo setcap cap_bpf+ep ./your_program
   ```

3. **Verification failed**: Check kernel version (5.8+ recommended)
   ```bash
   uname -r
   ```

## Development Guidelines

When adding new eBPF programs:

1. Follow the existing structure and naming conventions
2. Include comprehensive comments
3. Add appropriate security checks
4. Update the Makefile
5. Add integration tests
