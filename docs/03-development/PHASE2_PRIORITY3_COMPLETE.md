**New Files Created:**

- `advanced_manager.rs` (1,500+ lines) - Complete Priority 3 implementation

**Files Modified:**

- `mod.rs` - Added advanced_manager module export
- `syscalls/mod.rs` - Integrated process manager with syscalls

### Syscall Integration

All process-related syscalls now use the advanced process manager:

```rust
// Fork - Creates child process with full PCB
sys_fork() -> get_process_manager().fork_process()

// Exec - Program execution with environment
sys_execve() -> get_process_manager().exec_process()

// Exit - Process termination with cleanup
sys_exit() -> get_process_manager().exit_process()

// Wait - Child process synchronization
sys_wait4() -> get_process_manager().wait_for_process()

// Kill - Signal delivery
sys_kill() -> get_process_manager().kill_process()
```

### Testing & Verification
