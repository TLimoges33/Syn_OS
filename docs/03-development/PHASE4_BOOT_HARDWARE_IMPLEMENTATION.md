### 🔧 Technical Components

#### Bootloader Enhancements

```c
// Advanced UEFI boot support
struct UEFIBootServices {
    void (*locate_protocol)(EFI_GUID *protocol, void **interface);
    void (*allocate_pages)(UINTN pages, EFI_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS *memory);
    void (*exit_boot_services)(EFI_HANDLE image_handle, UINTN map_key);
};

// Secure boot verification
int verify_kernel_signature(void *kernel_image, size_t size);
```

#### Hardware Abstraction Layer

```rust
// Device driver framework
pub trait DeviceDriver {
    fn probe(&self, device: &Device) -> Result<(), DriverError>;
    fn remove(&self, device: &Device) -> Result<(), DriverError>;
    fn suspend(&self, device: &Device) -> Result<(), DriverError>;
    fn resume(&self, device: &Device) -> Result<(), DriverError>;
}

// PCI bus management
pub struct PCIManager {
    devices: Vec<PCIDevice>,
    drivers: HashMap<u32, Box<dyn DeviceDriver>>,
}
```
