# Build Script v2.4.2 - Permission Issues Fix

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Version:** v2.4.2  
**Changes:** Fixed "Operation not permitted" errors during build cleanup

---

## üêõ Bug Fixed

### Issue

Users experienced "Operation not permitted" errors when running:

```bash
./scripts/build-full-distribution.sh --clean --fresh
```

### Root Cause

1. Previous builds created files as root (when run with sudo)
2. Cleanup attempted to delete root-owned files without sudo
3. Resulted in permission denied errors

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Cleanup Logic (build-full-distribution.sh)

**Improved cleanup order:**

```bash
# OLD: Create directories, then try to clean
mkdir -p "$BUILD_DIR"
if [ "$CLEAN_BUILD" = true ]; then
    sudo rm -rf "$BUILD_DIR"  # Fails if mkdir was already done
fi

# NEW: Clean FIRST, then create
if [ "$CLEAN_BUILD" = true ]; then
    if [ "$(find "$BUILD_DIR" -user root 2>/dev/null | head -1)" ]; then
        echo "Detected root-owned files, using sudo..."
    fi
    sudo rm -rf "$BUILD_DIR"  # Succeeds
fi
mkdir -p "$BUILD_DIR"  # Now creates fresh
```

**Added error handling:**

```bash
sudo rm -rf "$BUILD_DIR" || {
    echo "‚úó Failed to remove build directory."
    echo "Try: sudo rm -rf $BUILD_DIR"
    exit 1
}
```

### 2. New Cleanup Utility Script

**Created:** `scripts/utilities/clean-build-artifacts.sh`

**Features:**

-   Detects root-owned files
-   Shows what will be removed (with sizes)
-   Asks for confirmation
-   Unmounts chroot filesystems
-   Safely removes entire build directory
-   Provides helpful status messages

**Usage:**

```bash
sudo ./scripts/utilities/clean-build-artifacts.sh
```

### 3. Documentation

**Created:** `docs/03-build/PERMISSION_ISSUES_SOLUTION.md`

**Contents:**

-   Problem explanation
-   Multiple solutions
-   Prevention checklist
-   Common error messages
-   Best practices

```bash
# Unmount and remove manually
sudo umount -l build/full-distribution/chroot/{sys,proc,dev}
sudo rm -rf build/full-distribution/
```

## ‚úÖ Testing

**Test 1: Cleanup script**

```bash
$ sudo ./scripts/utilities/clean-build-artifacts.sh
‚úì Detected 756M chroot directory
‚úì Asks for confirmation
‚úì Unmounts filesystems
‚úì Removes directory successfully
```

**Test 2: Build with --clean**

```bash
$ sudo ./scripts/build-full-distribution.sh --clean --fresh
‚úì Detects root-owned files
‚úì Uses sudo for cleanup
‚úì Cleans successfully
‚úì Continues with build
```

## üìã Checklist for Users

-   [x] Always run build script with `sudo`
-   [x] Use `--clean --fresh` for first build
