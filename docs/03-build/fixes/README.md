## Recent Critical Fixes

### Certificate & GPG Key Fix (October 14, 2025)

**Solution**:

-   Added `0000-fix-certificates.hook.chroot` to install ca-certificates BEFORE repository configuration
-   Added GPG key imports for Debian and ParrotOS
-   Changed ParrotOS repos from HTTPS to HTTP for initial bootstrap
-   Added ca-certificates to base package list

**Files Modified**: `scripts/02-build/BUILD-COMPLETE-SYNOS-DISTRIBUTION.sh`

### Directory Creation Fix (October 14, 2025)

**Problem**: Line 1709 error - missing directory when creating first-boot scripts.

**Solution**: Added directory creation at Phase 8 start:

```bash
mkdir -p config/includes.chroot/usr/local/bin
mkdir -p config/includes.chroot/usr/share/doc/synos
```
