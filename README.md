A security-first operating system integrating AI consciousness with cybersecurity fundamentals. Built to address the critical vulnerabilities identified in legacy systems through clean architecture and zero-trust principles.

## Overview

Syn_OS is a complete rebuild focused on:
- **Security-first design** - Every component validated and hardened
- **Zero-trust architecture** - Continuous verification and minimal access
- **AI integration** - Local AI processing with LM Studio compatibility  
- **Clean codebase** - Replacing compromised legacy systems

## Architecture

```

├── security/           # Authentication, encryption, validation
├── consciousness/      # AI decision engine and learning systems
├── kernel/            # eBPF programs and system monitoring
└── frontend/          # User interfaces and dashboards
```

## Security Features

- Input validation and sanitization for all external data
- mTLS encryption for all network communications
- Hardware security module (HSM) integration
- Real-time threat detection with eBPF monitoring
- Role-based access control with dynamic permissions

## AI Capabilities

- Local AI processing (offline-first)
- Adaptive decision making based on system patterns
- Resource optimization and performance tuning
- Anomaly detection and automated response
- Compatible with standard ML frameworks
