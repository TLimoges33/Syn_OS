### 7.2 Consciousness Architecture Analysis

**Critical Finding: Consciousness Implementation Gap**

After examining the actual consciousness system implementation:

1. **Simple State Machine**: The consciousness system is implemented as a basic state machine with hardcoded values, not actual consciousness algorithms

4. **Missing Core Components**: No Global Workspace Theory, attention mechanisms, or neural population dynamics

**Code Evidence:**
```python
# consciousness_bus.py line 62
async def get_consciousness_state(self):
    return {
        'overall_consciousness_level': 0.7,  # Hardcoded value
        'neural_populations': {},            # Empty

**Code Evidence:**
```python
# ai_orchestration_engine.py lines 602-614
async def _process_through_gemini(self, request: AIRequest) -> AIResponse:
    """Process request through Gemini (placeholder)"""
    # TODO: Implement Gemini processing
