## Next Immediate Actions

### Critical Priority (This Week)
1. **Set up ParrotOS 6.4 development environment**
2. **Research TensorFlow Lite + ONNX Runtime for Debian integration**
3. **Audit existing Parrot security tools for AI integration potential**
4. **Design package structure for AI consciousness components**
5. **Create initial live-build configuration for SynOS**

### Build Commands
```bash
# Install live-build tools
sudo apt update && sudo apt install live-build debootstrap

# Create workspace
mkdir -p SynOS-Linux-Builder
cd SynOS-Linux-Builder

# Initialize live-build configuration
lb config --distribution bookworm --archive-areas "main contrib non-free non-free-firmware"
```

### Development Environment
- **Host OS**: Ubuntu/Debian for live-build toolchain
- **Target**: ParrotOS 6.4 base with SynOS AI extensions
- **Architecture**: x86_64 with future ARM support
- **Package Manager**: APT/dpkg with custom SynOS repository

## Project Timeline
- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-2): Linux distribution foundation
