## Current State

### What's Running

- ParrotOS clone in progress (Terminal 2)
- All core components implemented
- Build system ready for ISO generation

### Next Immediate Steps

1. **Complete ParrotOS Clone**
   - Monitor git clone completion
   - Verify repository integrity

2. **Build ISO**

   ```bash
   cd parrotos-synapticos
   sudo ./build.sh --full
```text

```text

```text
```text

1. **Testing Phase**
   - Boot ISO in QEMU/VirtualBox
   - Verify overlay integration
   - Test AI components
   - Validate security features

## Documentation Updates Required

Based on the documentation audit:

1. **Version Standardization**
   - Update all references to v2.0 (ParrotOS fork)
   - Remove v1.0 references

2. **Deprecate Old Documents**
   - Add deprecation notice to AI_AGENT_TASK_INSTRUCTIONS.md
   - Archive pre-pivot documentation

3. **Create Missing Guides**
   - USER_GUIDE.md for end users
   - INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md
   - DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md

## Success Metrics Achieved

### Technical Implementation ✅

- All core components implemented
- Clean architecture with overlay design
- Modular, maintainable codebase
- Security-first implementation

### AI Integration ✅
