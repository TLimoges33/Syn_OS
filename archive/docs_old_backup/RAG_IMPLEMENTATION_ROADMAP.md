## Implementation Overview

### Project Scope

The RAG implementation adds comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation capabilities to your existing SynapticOS consciousness system. This implementation will:

- **Enhance Intelligence**: Add knowledge-augmented responses to all AI interactions
- **Improve Memory**: Provide persistent memory for consciousness states and user interactions
- **Enable Learning**: Create adaptive learning through consciousness-driven knowledge retrieval
- **Maintain Compatibility**: Integrate seamlessly without disrupting existing functionality
