## Security-First Development Guidelines

### 🛡️ Security Requirements

## ALL code must pass these security checks before merge:

1. **Input Validation** - Every external input must be validated and sanitized
2. **No Command Injection** - Use parameterized queries and validated commands only
3. **Encryption Everywhere** - All data at rest and in transit must be encrypted
4. **Least Privilege** - Code must follow principle of least privilege
5. **Security Scan Clean** - Must pass SAST and dependency vulnerability scans

### 🧪 Testing Standards

- **Unit Tests**: >90% coverage required
- **Integration Tests**: All API endpoints tested
- **Security Tests**: Penetration testing for all components
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing with benchmarks
- **AI Tests**: Model accuracy and response time validation

### 🔄 Development Workflow

1. **Create Feature Branch** from `develop`
2. **Implement with Security** - Follow security guidelines
3. **Write Tests First** - TDD approach required
4. **Security Review** - Self-review against security checklist
5. **Submit PR** - Include test results and security analysis
6. **Peer Review** - Two approvals required including security expert
7. **Automated Testing** - All CI/CD checks must pass
8. **Merge to Develop** - After all approvals

### 📝 Code Standards

#### Rust (Security Components)

```rust
// Always validate inputs
fn process_user_input(input: &str) -> Result<ProcessedData, SecurityError> {
    validate_input(input)?;
    sanitize_input(input)
}

// Use type safety
struct ValidatedCommand(String);
impl ValidatedCommand {
    fn new(cmd: &str) -> Result<Self, ValidationError> {
        validate_command(cmd)?;
        Ok(ValidatedCommand(cmd.to_string()))
    }
}
```text

// Use type safety
struct ValidatedCommand(String);
impl ValidatedCommand {
    fn new(cmd: &str) -> Result<Self, ValidationError> {
        validate_command(cmd)?;
        Ok(ValidatedCommand(cmd.to_string()))
    }
}

```text

// Use type safety
struct ValidatedCommand(String);
impl ValidatedCommand {
    fn new(cmd: &str) -> Result<Self, ValidationError> {
        validate_command(cmd)?;
        Ok(ValidatedCommand(cmd.to_string()))
    }
}

```text
        validate_command(cmd)?;
        Ok(ValidatedCommand(cmd.to_string()))
    }
}

```text

#### Python (AI Components)

```python

```python
```python

```python

## Input validation for AI components

from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

class AIRequest(BaseModel):
    prompt: str
    model: str

    @validator('prompt')
    def validate_prompt(cls, v):
        return sanitize_prompt(v)
```text

class AIRequest(BaseModel):
    prompt: str
    model: str

    @validator('prompt')
    def validate_prompt(cls, v):
        return sanitize_prompt(v)

```text
class AIRequest(BaseModel):
    prompt: str
    model: str

    @validator('prompt')
    def validate_prompt(cls, v):
        return sanitize_prompt(v)

```text
    def validate_prompt(cls, v):
        return sanitize_prompt(v)

```text

#### Go (Performance Components)

```go
```go

```go

```go
// Error handling and validation
func ProcessMessage(msg []byte) error {
    if err := validateMessage(msg); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("invalid message: %w", err)
    }
    return processValidMessage(msg)
}
```text

    return processValidMessage(msg)
}

```text
    return processValidMessage(msg)
}

```text
```text

### 🏗️ Architecture Principles

1. **Zero Trust** - Never trust, always verify
2. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple security layers
3. **Fail Secure** - Default to secure state on failure
4. **Separation of Concerns** - Modular, loosely coupled design
5. **Performance by Design** - Optimize for sub-10ms response times

### 🚨 Security Checklist

Before submitting any PR, verify:

- [ ] All inputs validated and sanitized
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Proper error handling without information leakage
- [ ] Encrypted storage for sensitive data
- [ ] Secure communication protocols (mTLS)
- [ ] Principle of least privilege applied
- [ ] Security tests written and passing
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scan clean
- [ ] Code review by security team member

### 📊 Quality Gates

## Automated checks that must pass:

- Security scan (SAST) - Zero high/critical issues
- Dependency scan - Zero known vulnerabilities
- Unit tests - >90% coverage
- Integration tests - All passing
- Performance tests - Meet latency requirements
- Code quality - Maintainability score >8/10

### 🎯 Component Guidelines

#### Security Components (Rust)

- Memory safety guaranteed
- Zero unsafe blocks without justification
- Comprehensive error handling
- Fuzz testing for parsers

#### AI Components (Python)

- Model validation and testing
- Resource usage monitoring
- Graceful degradation on failure
- Offline-first operation

#### Kernel Components (C/eBPF)

- Minimal overhead (<1%)
- Comprehensive testing in VMs
- Kernel version compatibility
- Security audit required

#### Frontend Components (TypeScript)

- CSP headers for XSS prevention
- Input sanitization on client
- Secure authentication flows
- Real-time security monitoring

### 🆘 Getting Help

- Security questions: Create issue with `security` label
- Architecture questions: Check `docs/architecture/`
- Development setup: See `scripts/setup/`
- Performance issues: Use `performance` label

Remember: **Security is everyone's responsibility**

1. **Fail Secure** - Default to secure state on failure
2. **Separation of Concerns** - Modular, loosely coupled design
3. **Performance by Design** - Optimize for sub-10ms response times
