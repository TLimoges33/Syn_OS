# Syn_OS Historical Archive

This directory contains historical reference documentation extracted from legacy archives. All binary content, executables, and sensitive data have been removed for security. Only code examples and documentation remain for historical reference.

## Structure

- **development_scripts/**: Historical development and setup scripts as markdown documentation
- **legacy_code_examples/**: Code examples and implementations from previous phases
- **devcontainer_configs/**: Development container configurations and setup scripts
- **phase_documentation/**: Documentation from various development phases

## Security Note

All credential stores, encrypted files, and binary executables have been removed. This archive contains only sanitized code examples and documentation for reference purposes.

## Usage

These files are for **historical reference only** and should not be executed directly. They serve as documentation of the project's evolution and development practices.
