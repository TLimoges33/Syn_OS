# Dev Team Setup Tool

Historical reference from legacy development scripts.

## Overview

This Python script was designed to create structured feature branches for development team members and manage documentation mirroring between repositories.

## Key Features

### Feature Branch Structure
The tool defined a comprehensive branching strategy:

```python
feature_branches = {
    "feature/consciousness-kernel": {
        "description": "Advanced consciousness integration and neural processing",
        "lead": "Consciousness Team",
        "focus": ["src/consciousness/", "src/neural/", "tests/consciousness/"],
        "priority": "HIGH"
    },
    "feature/security-framework": {
        "description": "Security hardening and cryptographic improvements", 
        "lead": "Security Team",
        "focus": ["src/security/", "security/", "tests/security/"],
        "priority": "CRITICAL"
    },
    "feature/education-platform": {
        "description": "Educational platform development and curriculum",
        "lead": "Education Team", 
        "focus": ["education/", "community/", "docs/education/"],
        "priority": "HIGH"
    },
    "feature/performance-optimization": {
        "description": "System performance and scalability improvements",
        "lead": "Performance Team",
        "focus": ["src/performance/", "benchmarks/", "optimization/"],
        "priority": "MEDIUM"
    }
}
```

### Repository Management
- Automated branch creation and management
- Documentation mirroring between repositories
- Team-specific focus area assignments
- Priority-based development workflow

## Usage Pattern

This tool demonstrates organized development practices with:
- Clear team responsibilities
- Structured branching strategy
- Documentation synchronization
- Priority-based development focus

## Modern Application

The branching strategy and team organization principles from this tool remain valuable for current development practices, though the specific implementation should be updated for current infrastructure.
