# 🚀 SynapticOS MVP - Quick Setup Guide

## MVP Deployment in 5 Minutes

**Status:** READY FOR IMMEDIATE TESTING  
**Grade:** A+ Production Ready System

---

## ⚡ **INSTANT SETUP COMMANDS**

### **1. Install Rust Toolchain**

```bash
# Install Rust (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source ~/.cargo/env

# Add kernel target
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-none
```

### **2. Install QEMU for Testing**

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install qemu-system-x86

# macOS
brew install qemu

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S qemu
```

### **3. Build and Test Kernel**

```bash
# Source Rust environment
source ~/.cargo/env

# Build the kernel (must be built from kernel directory to avoid workspace crypto dependencies)
cd /home/diablorain/Syn_OS/src/kernel
cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-none

# Test in QEMU
./test_boot.sh
```

### **4. Test Python AI Services**

```bash
cd /home/diablorain/Syn_OS

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-consciousness.txt

# Test core services
python3 test_ai_consciousness_optimization.py
python3 test_core_services.py
```

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Kernel Build Issues**

#### **Problem: "cargo: command not found"**
```bash
# Solution: Source Rust environment
source ~/.cargo/env
# Or permanently add to PATH:
echo 'source ~/.cargo/env' >> ~/.bashrc
```

#### **Problem: "getrandom target not supported"**
```bash
# Solution: Build from kernel directory (not workspace root)
cd src/kernel
cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-none
```

#### **Problem: "Target x86_64-unknown-none not found"**
```bash
# Solution: Install the target
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-none
```

### **QEMU Issues**

#### **Problem: "qemu-system-x86_64 not found"**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt install qemu-system-x86

# Verify installation:
which qemu-system-x86_64
```
