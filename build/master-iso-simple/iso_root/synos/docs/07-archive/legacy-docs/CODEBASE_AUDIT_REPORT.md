#### Architecture Consistency

- **Blueprint vs Implementation**: The architecture blueprint is comprehensive but implementation is fragmented
- **Multiple Paradigms**: Rust kernel + Python AI + C modules + Docker services
- **Deployment Complexity**: Three different deployment approaches identified

### 2. Component Status Assessment

- **Neural Darwinism Engine** (Python-based, old-synapticos)
- **LM Studio Integration** (Python-based, old-synapticos)
- **Personal Context Engine** (Python-based, old-synapticos)
- **DevContainer Environment** (Comprehensive, functional)
- **Documentation Suite** (Extensive, well-organized)

#### In-Progress Components

- **Rust Kernel** (Basic structure, needs implementation)
- **Security Framework** (Architecture defined, minimal code)
- **Frontend** (Directory structure only)
