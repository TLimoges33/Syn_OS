- **Build System**: Automated ISO generation with consciousness features

### 2. **AI Consciousness System**

- **Neural Darwinism Engine** (`neural_darwinism.py`)
  - Evolutionary neural populations
  - Competitive selection mechanisms
  - Consciousness emergence detection
  - Based on Gerald Edelman's Theory

### 3. **LM Studio Integration**

- **Local AI Processing** (`lm_studio_client.py`)
  - Privacy-focused local inference
  - Streaming responses
  - Conversation management
  - Consciousness AI interface

### 4. **Personal Context Engine**

- **Adaptive Learning** (`personal_context.py`)
  - Skill level tracking (Beginner → Expert)
  - Activity recording and analysis
  - Personalized recommendations
  - Achievement system

### 5. **Security Tutor Module**

- **Interactive Education** (`security_tutor.py`)
  - 9 security domains covered
  - Theory, hands-on, and challenges
  - Adaptive difficulty based on skill
  - Progress tracking

### 6. **Kernel Modifications**

- **Microprocess API** (`synapticos_microprocess.c`)
  - AI-OS interaction at kernel level
  - Consciousness metrics tracking
  - Process monitoring
  - Real-time adaptation

### 7. **Integration & Testing**
