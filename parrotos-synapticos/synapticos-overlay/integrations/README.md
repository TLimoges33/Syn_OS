# SynapticsOS Third-Party Integrations Infrastructure

This directory contains the secure infrastructure for integrating third-party AI services into SynapticsOS.

## Architecture Overview

## Security Principles

1. **Zero Trust Architecture**: No service trusts any other service by default
2. **Container Isolation**: Each service runs in its own container with minimal privileges
3. **Encrypted Communication**: All inter-service communication uses mTLS
4. **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded credentials, all secrets in Vault
5. **Network Segmentation**: Services grouped by security zones
6. **Audit Logging**: All API calls and service interactions logged
7. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and control costs
