# SynapticsOS Integration Security Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the security architecture for integrating third-party AI services into SynapticsOS. Our approach follows Zero Trust principles with defense-in-depth strategies.

## Security Zones

### Zone 1: Critical Infrastructure (172.20.1.0/24)
**Highest Security Level**
- **Services**: Vault, Kong API Gateway, n8n, Monitoring Stack
- **Access**: Strictly controlled, audit logged
- **Purpose**: Core security and orchestration services

### Zone 2: Core Services (172.20.2.0/24)
**High Security Level**
- **Services**: Context Engine, Knowledge Database
- **Access**: Only from Zone 1
- **Purpose**: Core AI processing and data storage

### Zone 3: Application Services (172.20.3.0/24)
**Standard Security Level**
- **Services**: JaceAI, Speechify, Descript, Media Services
- **Access**: Via API Gateway only
- **Purpose**: User-facing AI services

### Zone 4: DMZ (172.20.4.0/24)
**External Communication Zone**
- **Services**: Vercel Connector, External API Integrations
- **Access**: Restricted outbound, no direct inbound
- **Purpose**: Communication with external services

## Security Components

### 1. API Gateway (Kong)
- **Authentication**: Custom Vault-based authentication plugin
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-service and per-consumer limits
- **Security Features**:
  - IP whitelisting for admin endpoints
  - Bot detection and blocking
  - Request/response transformation
  - CORS policy enforcement
  - SSL/TLS termination

### 2. Secrets Management (HashiCorp Vault)
- **Purpose**: Centralized secrets storage
- **Features**:
  - Dynamic secret generation
  - Secret rotation policies
  - Audit logging
  - Encryption at rest
- **Policies**:
  - `admin-policy`: Full access for administrators
  - `service-policy`: Read-only access for services

### 3. Network Segmentation
- **Implementation**: iptables rules with custom chains
- **Features**:
  - Zone-based traffic control
  - DDoS protection
  - Port scan detection
  - Rate limiting
  - Logging of violations

### 4. Container Security
- **Isolation**: Each service in separate container
- **Privileges**: Minimal required permissions
- **Networks**: Isolated Docker networks per zone
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory constraints

### 5. Monitoring & Alerting
- **Metrics**: Prometheus with security-focused alerts
- **Logs**: Centralized logging with Loki
- **Dashboards**: Grafana for security visualization
- **Alerts**:
  - Unauthorized access attempts
  - Certificate expiration
  - Anomalous traffic patterns
  - Service health issues

## Authentication Flow

```
User Request → Kong Gateway → Vault Auth Plugin → Validate API Key → Service
                    ↓                                      ↓
                Rate Limit                          Audit Log
                    ↓
                IP Check
                    ↓
                Transform
```

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **At Rest**: Encrypted volumes for sensitive data
- **Key Management**: Vault-managed encryption keys

### Data Classification
- **Critical**: API keys, passwords, tokens
- **Sensitive**: User data, AI model outputs
- **Internal**: Service configurations, logs
- **Public**: Documentation, metrics

## Compliance & Auditing

### Audit Logging
- All API access logged
- Authentication attempts tracked
- Configuration changes recorded
- Network violations logged

### Compliance Features
- GDPR-ready data retention policies
- SOC2-compliant access controls
- ISO 27001 security practices
- Regular security assessments

## Incident Response

### Detection
1. Real-time monitoring alerts
2. Anomaly detection in traffic patterns
3. Failed authentication tracking
4. Network segmentation violations

### Response Procedures
1. Automatic rate limiting and blocking
2. Alert to security team
3. Isolate affected services
4. Investigate and remediate
5. Post-incident review

## Security Best Practices

### Development
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Dependency vulnerability checking
- Code review requirements
- Secure coding standards

### Operations
- Regular security updates
- Automated patch management
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Disaster recovery planning

### Access Control
- Principle of least privilege
- Multi-factor authentication for admin
- Regular access reviews
- Service account management
