## Summary
- **Files Processed**: 130093
- **Vulnerabilities Fixed**: 65

## Security Improvements Applied

### 1. Environment Variable Usage
- Replaced hardcoded paths with `${PROJECT_ROOT}`
- Implemented dynamic project root detection
- Added path validation and security checks

### 2. Secure Configuration

- Enforced relative path usage
- Added security validation in all scripts

## Validation Commands

```bash
# Test secure environment loading
source config/environment-secure.sh

# Verify no hardcoded paths remain
grep -r "/home/diablorain" scripts/ || echo "✅ No hardcoded paths found"

# Test build scripts work with new environment
./scripts/build-syn-iso.sh --dry-run
```
