# SynOS AI Consciousness System

This directory contains the AI consciousness daemon that provides real-time security monitoring and threat detection using Neural Darwinism principles.

## Components

### `consciousness-daemon.py`
Main AI consciousness daemon that provides:
- Real-time security event monitoring
- AI-driven threat detection and pattern recognition
- NATS message bus integration for distributed awareness
- Consciousness state tracking (threat levels, patterns, system health)
- RESTful API for security tool orchestration

## Architecture

The consciousness system implements a Neural Darwinism-based approach where:
1. **Security events** are continuously monitored from multiple sources
2. **Pattern recognition** identifies known attack patterns and anomalies
3. **Consciousness state** maintains awareness of current threat landscape
4. **Self-healing** through automatic threat level decay over time
5. **Distributed awareness** via NATS message bus integration

## Usage

```bash
# Start the consciousness daemon
sudo systemctl start synos-consciousness

# Check status
sudo systemctl status synos-consciousness

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u synos-consciousness -f
```

## Integration

The consciousness daemon integrates with:
- **ALFRED** (voice assistant) - Receives voice commands and alerts
- **Security Orchestrator** - Coordinates security tool execution
- **CTF Platform** - Feeds security challenges and training data
- **Universal Command** - Unified tool interface

## Development Status

**Current:** 90% complete (314 lines functional)
- ✅ Core consciousness state tracking
- ✅ Pattern recognition engine
- ✅ NATS message bus integration
- ✅ Security event monitoring
- ✅ Threat level management
- ⏳ ML model integration (pending)
- ⏳ Advanced anomaly detection (pending)
