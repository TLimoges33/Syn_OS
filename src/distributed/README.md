# Distributed Systems (Experimental)

**Status:** ⚠️ Experimental - Not in Production  
**Integration:** Not included in workspace build  
**Purpose:** Research and development of distributed consciousness systems

## ⚠️ Warning

This directory contains experimental distributed systems code that is **NOT** integrated into the main SynOS build. Code may be incomplete, untested, or non-functional.

## Contents

### `cluster/`

Cluster management and coordination for distributed SynOS instances.

### `consciousness/`

Distributed consciousness algorithms allowing multiple AI instances to share state and learning.

### `consensus/`

Consensus algorithms for distributed decision-making (Raft, Paxos variants).

### `learning/`

Distributed machine learning and federated learning implementations.

### `synchronization/`

State synchronization mechanisms for keeping distributed nodes coherent.

## Integration Roadmap

To integrate this code into production:

1. **Create Package Structure**

    ```bash
    cd src/distributed
    cargo init --lib
    ```

2. **Add Dependencies**

    - async-raft or similar consensus library
    - distributed-kv for state management
    - Proper error handling with thiserror/anyhow

3. **Testing Requirements**

    - Unit tests for each module
    - Integration tests with multiple nodes
    - Chaos engineering tests
    - Performance benchmarks

4. **Documentation**

    - Architecture diagrams
    - API documentation
    - Deployment guide
    - Troubleshooting guide

5. **Add to Workspace**
   Edit `/home/diablorain/Syn_OS/Cargo.toml`:
    ```toml
    members = [
        # ... existing members ...
        "src/distributed",
    ]
    ```

## Research Goals

-   Distributed AI consciousness with <10ms latency
-   Byzantine fault tolerance for AI decision-making
-   Federated learning across distributed nodes
-   Zero-trust distributed authentication

## Status: Not Production Ready

**Blockers:**

-   [ ] No Cargo.toml (not a proper package)
-   [ ] Incomplete implementations
-   [ ] No test coverage
-   [ ] Missing documentation
-   [ ] No CI/CD integration
