# Executive Dashboard (Experimental)

**Status:** ⚠️ Experimental - Business Intelligence Prototype  
**Integration:** Not included in workspace build  
**Purpose:** Executive-level business metrics and reporting

## ⚠️ Status: Prototype

This directory contains business intelligence code for C-level executives. Currently **NOT** integrated into production builds.

## Files

### `compliance_scoring.rs`

**Purpose:** Calculate and track compliance scores  
**Metrics:**

-   Industry standard compliance percentages
-   Regulatory framework adherence
-   Audit readiness scores

### `risk_metrics.rs`

**Purpose:** Risk assessment and quantification  
**Metrics:**

-   Security posture scores
-   Threat exposure levels
-   Vulnerability density

### `roi_analysis.rs`

**Purpose:** Return on investment calculations  
**Metrics:**

-   Security investment ROI
-   Incident cost analysis
-   Prevention vs remediation costs

## Use Cases

Designed for:

-   CISO dashboards
-   Board presentations
-   Compliance reporting
-   Budget justification
-   Risk communication to non-technical stakeholders

## Integration Options

### Option 1: Merge into Analytics

Integrate as a feature module in `src/analytics/`:

```toml
[features]
default = []
executive-dashboard = []
```

### Option 2: Standalone Package

Create dedicated package for business intelligence:

```toml
[package]
name = "synos-executive-dashboard"
version = "1.0.0"

[dependencies]
synos-analytics = { path = "../analytics" }
synos-compliance-runner = { path = "../compliance-runner" }
```

### Option 3: Web Service

Deploy as separate microservice with REST API for dashboard frontends.

## Data Requirements

Needs integration with:

-   `src/analytics/` - Security event data
-   `src/compliance-runner/` - Compliance check results
-   `src/threat-intel/` - Threat intelligence feeds
-   `src/zero-trust-engine/` - Policy compliance data

## Current Blockers

-   [ ] No Cargo.toml (not a package)
-   [ ] No data source integration
-   [ ] No visualization layer
-   [ ] No API endpoints
-   [ ] No authentication/authorization
-   [ ] No test coverage

## Roadmap

1. **Phase 1:** Create proper package structure
2. **Phase 2:** Integrate with analytics backend
3. **Phase 3:** Add REST API endpoints
4. **Phase 4:** Create web dashboard frontend
5. **Phase 5:** Add PDF report generation
6. **Phase 6:** Production deployment

## Example Output

```rust
Executive metrics:
- Overall Security Posture: 87/100
- Compliance Score: 94% (PCI-DSS: 98%, HIPAA: 91%, SOC2: 93%)
- Risk Level: Medium (Score: 42/100)
- Monthly Security ROI: 340%
- Incidents Prevented: 127
- Cost Savings: $2.4M (vs industry average)
```
