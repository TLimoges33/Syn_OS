# Experimental Features

**Status:** ⚠️ Experimental - Prototype Code  
**Integration:** Not included in workspace build  
**Purpose:** Sandbox for cutting-edge feature development

## ⚠️ Caveat Emptor

This directory is a **prototype sandbox**. Code here may:

-   Not compile
-   Have incomplete implementations
-   Lack documentation
-   Break existing functionality
-   Require external dependencies not in workspace

**Use at your own risk. Not for production.**

## Subdirectories

### `cloud_native/`

**Purpose:** Cloud-native architecture experiments  
**Status:** Prototype  
**Features:** Kubernetes-native integration, cloud-agnostic deployments

### `edge_computing/`

**Purpose:** Edge computing and IoT integration  
**Status:** Research  
**Features:** Edge AI inference, distributed edge nodes

### `enterprise/`

**Purpose:** Enterprise-specific features  
**Status:** Prototype  
**Features:** SSO integration, LDAP, enterprise compliance

### `galactic/`

**Purpose:** Large-scale orchestration (thousands of nodes)  
**Status:** Concept  
**Features:** Global-scale deployment, multi-region sync

### `multi_cloud/`

**Purpose:** Advanced multi-cloud orchestration  
**Status:** Prototype  
**Features:** Cross-cloud workload migration, unified management

## Philosophy

This directory embodies **move fast and break things** development:

-   Rapid prototyping encouraged
-   Breaking changes acceptable
-   Documentation optional
-   Tests optional
-   Dependencies can be experimental

## Graduation Path

For code to move from experimental to production (`src/` root):

1. **Stability:** No crashes, handles errors gracefully
2. **Testing:** ≥80% code coverage with integration tests
3. **Documentation:** Complete API docs and usage guide
4. **Review:** Code review by 2+ team members
5. **Integration:** Successfully integrates with existing systems
6. **Performance:** Meets performance benchmarks

## Currently Active Experiments

_(Update this section as experiments progress)_

-   Cloud-native kubernetes operator
-   Edge AI inference optimization
-   Enterprise SSO integration
-   Global-scale consensus algorithms

## Archive Policy

Experiments inactive for >6 months may be archived to `archive/experimental/`.
