# 🗃️ Archive Configuration

## 📁 Archived Configuration Files

This directory contains rarely used or archived configuration files.

### **Recently Relocated**

- **`enterprise_mssp.yaml`** - ⚠️ **MOVED** to `/config/security/enterprise_mssp.yaml` (September 17, 2025)
  - Reason: Active enterprise configuration should not be in archive
  - New Location: `/config/security/enterprise_mssp.yaml`

### **Historical Reference**

_No archived configurations currently present - all active configs have been relocated_

## 🔗 Archive Policy

Configurations are archived when:

- No longer actively used in current development
- Superseded by newer configuration formats
- Specialized for specific deployment scenarios
- Historical reference value only

**⚠️ Important**: Archive directories should contain only documentation and historical references, not active configurations.

## 🚀 Restoration

```bash
# Template for restoring archived configuration
# cp config/archive/[filename] config/[target_directory]/

# Always review and update before use
# (May require updates for current system compatibility)
```
