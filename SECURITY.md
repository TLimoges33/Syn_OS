# Security Policy

## 🛡️ SynOS Security Commitment

SynOS is a security-focused operating system designed for cybersecurity professionals, penetration testers, and security researchers. We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate the security community's efforts in responsibly disclosing issues.

## 🔒 Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          | Status                     |
| ------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: | Active development         |
| < 1.0   | :x:                | Development/Alpha versions |

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them responsibly using one of the following methods:

### Primary Contact

-   **Email**: security@synos.dev (or TLimoges33@github - update as needed)
-   **PGP Key**: Available upon request
-   **Response Time**: We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours

### What to Include in Your Report

To help us triage and address the issue quickly, please include:

1. **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., privilege escalation, memory corruption, authentication bypass)
2. **Full paths** of source files related to the issue
3. **Location** of the affected code (commit hash, branch, or direct URL)
4. **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
5. **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if available)
6. **Impact assessment** - what can an attacker achieve?
7. **Suggested fix** (if you have one)

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of submission
2. **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days, we'll provide:
    - Confirmation of the issue
    - Severity rating (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
    - Estimated timeline for fix
3. **Progress Updates**: Every 7 days until resolved
4. **Resolution**:
    - Critical: 7-14 days
    - High: 14-30 days
    - Medium: 30-60 days
    - Low: 60-90 days
5. **Credit**: Public acknowledgment in release notes (if desired)

## 🏆 Security Hall of Fame

We maintain a Security Researchers Hall of Fame to recognize those who help improve SynOS security:

## 🎯 Scope

### In Scope

-   ✅ Kernel vulnerabilities (privilege escalation, memory corruption)
-   ✅ AI service daemons (injection, authentication bypass)
-   ✅ Container escape vulnerabilities
-   ✅ Authentication and authorization flaws
-   ✅ Cryptographic weaknesses
-   ✅ Remote code execution
-   ✅ Security tool misconfigurations
-   ✅ Supply chain vulnerabilities

### Out of Scope

-   ❌ Social engineering attacks
-   ❌ Physical access attacks
-   ❌ Denial of Service (unless it leads to code execution)
-   ❌ Issues in third-party security tools (report to upstream)
-   ❌ Known issues already documented in TODO.md or issue tracker

## 🔐 Security Features

SynOS includes multiple security layers:

### Kernel Level

-   Custom Rust kernel with memory safety
-   Process isolation and sandboxing
-   Capability-based security model
-   Secure boot support

### AI Services

-   Service isolation via systemd hardening
-   Restricted filesystem access
-   Network namespace isolation
-   Non-root execution where possible

### System Hardening

-   SELinux/AppArmor profiles
-   Hardened kernel parameters
-   Minimal attack surface
-   Regular security updates

## 📋 Security Best Practices

If you're using SynOS in production:

1. **Keep Updated**: Apply security patches promptly
2. **Monitor Logs**: Check `/var/log/synos/` for anomalies
3. **Network Isolation**: Run security assessments in isolated networks
4. **Verify Checksums**: Always verify ISO checksums before use
5. **Report Issues**: See something? Say something!

## 🔄 Security Update Process

1. Security fixes are prioritized above all other development
2. Patches are tested in isolated environments
3. Updates are released with detailed security advisories
4. CVE identifiers are requested for confirmed vulnerabilities
5. Fixes are backported to supported versions when applicable

## 📜 Disclosure Policy

We follow **Coordinated Disclosure**:

1. Report received and acknowledged
2. Issue validated and assessed
3. Fix developed and tested
4. Patch released to users
5. Public disclosure 30 days after patch release (or sooner if already public)

We request that security researchers:

-   Allow us reasonable time to fix issues before public disclosure
-   Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and data destruction
-   Avoid exploiting vulnerabilities beyond the minimum necessary to demonstrate impact

## 🤝 Bug Bounty Program

**Status**: Under consideration for future implementation

We're exploring partnerships with bug bounty platforms. Check back for updates!

## 📞 Additional Security Resources

-   **Security Documentation**: `/docs/security/`
-   **Threat Model**: `/docs/security/THREAT_MODEL.md`
-   **Security Audit Reports**: `/docs/security/audits/`
-   **Compliance Information**: `/docs/security/compliance/`

## 🔗 Security-Related Projects

SynOS integrates 500+ security tools. For vulnerabilities in specific tools:

-   Report to the upstream project first
-   If it affects SynOS integration, report to us as well
