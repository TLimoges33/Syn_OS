# SynOS Kernel Development Environment

This environment is optimized for developing the SynOS custom Rust kernel with consciousness integration.

## Features

- Complete Rust kernel development toolchain
- Consciousness integration patterns and examples
- Real process management development tools
- Educational-aware kernel scheduling
- Memory safety validation tools

## Getting Started

1. Source the environment: `source activate-kernel-dev.sh`
2. Build the kernel: `cargo build --release`
3. Test integration: `cargo test --features consciousness-integration`
4. Debug with consciousness: `./debug-consciousness-kernel.sh`

## Key Components

- `src/consciousness/` - Consciousness integration layer
- `src/process/` - Real process management
- `src/memory/` - Educational memory management
- `src/boot/` - Educational boot system

## Development Standards

All kernel code must follow SynOS standards:
- Memory safety first
- Consciousness integration required
- Educational context documented
- Performance targets met (300% improvement)
