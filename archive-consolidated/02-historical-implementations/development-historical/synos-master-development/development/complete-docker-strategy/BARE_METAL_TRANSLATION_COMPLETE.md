pub struct RealProcessManager {
    processes: BTreeMap<ProcessId, Process>,
    scheduler: EducationalScheduler,
    memory_manager: MemoryManager,
    consciousness: ConsciousnessLayer,
    analytics: ProcessAnalytics,
}

// Educational process spawning
pub fn spawn_security_tool(
    tool_type: SecurityToolType,
    educational_context: EducationalContext
) -> ProcessId {
    // Create isolated educational environment
    // Configure AI-guided learning
    // Launch with consciousness optimization
}
```

    virtual_targets: BTreeMap<u32, VirtualTargetEnvironment>,
    consciousness: ConsciousnessLayer,
}

// Create safe practice environment
pub fn create_practice_environment(
    tool_type: SecurityToolType,
    skill_level: SkillLevel
) -> PracticeEnvironment {
    // Isolated network segment
