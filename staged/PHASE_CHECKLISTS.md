# ðŸ“‹ Syn_OS Phase-Specific Checklists

This document provides actionable, copy-paste-ready checklists for each major phase of the ParrotOS â†’ Syn_OS roadmap. Use these to track progress, onboard contributors, and ensure nothing is missed.

---

## Phase 1: Fork & Initial Setup
- [ ] Fork ParrotOS (or base Debian/Parrot repo) to your GitHub
- [ ] Set up new repo: enable Issues, Actions, Codespaces
- [ ] Add `.devcontainer` and Codespace config
- [ ] Add `README.md`, `FIRST_RUN_CHECKLIST.md`, and `ROADMAP_PARROTOS_TO_SYNOS.md`
- [ ] Set up CI/CD (GitHub Actions for build/test)
- [ ] Document all changes from the start

## Phase 2: Minimal Bootable ISO
- [ ] Remove unnecessary packages/services from base ISO
- [ ] Add Syn_OS branding (boot splash, wallpapers, logos)
- [ ] Build minimal ISO: `./scripts/build-simple-kernel-iso.sh`
- [ ] Test ISO in VM (QEMU/VirtualBox)
- [ ] Document build and test process

## Phase 3: Kernel Customization
- [ ] Integrate custom kernel modules (Rust, security, consciousness hooks)
- [ ] Patch kernel for memory safety, zero-trust, and performance
- [ ] Add kernel-level logging and audit features
- [ ] Test kernel boots and modules load
- [ ] Document kernel changes and patches

## Phase 4: Security Hardening
- [ ] Harden sysctl, PAM, SSH, firewall configs
- [ ] Integrate secrets management and secure boot
- [ ] Add/verify automated security audit scripts
- [ ] Run `security-scan` and fix all critical issues
- [ ] Document all security changes

## Phase 5: Core Service Migration
- [ ] Replace ParrotOS services with Syn_OS microservices
- [ ] Migrate NATS messaging to kernel IPC
- [ ] Integrate AI/consciousness services
- [ ] Test all services start and communicate
- [ ] Document migration steps

## Phase 6: Userspace & Desktop
- [ ] Build GenAI desktop environment (custom shell, window manager)
- [ ] Integrate AI/Consciousness visualization tools
- [ ] Add educational and research apps
- [ ] Test desktop boots and apps run
- [ ] Document userspace changes

## Phase 7: Hardware & Performance
- [ ] Optimize for target hardware (laptops, servers, embedded)
- [ ] Add hardware abstraction and monitoring
- [ ] Benchmark and tune for performance
- [ ] Document hardware support and tuning

## Phase 8: Documentation & Community
- [ ] Write full user, developer, and deployment guides
- [ ] Set up community support channels (Discord, forums, etc.)
- [ ] Prepare for open beta and enterprise pilots
- [ ] Document all onboarding and support processes

## Phase 9: Production Release
- [ ] Finalize security, performance, and compliance audits
- [ ] Build and sign production ISOs
- [ ] Launch public and enterprise releases
- [ ] Announce release and onboard users
