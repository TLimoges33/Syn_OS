## üîç Technical Research Findings

### Root Cause Analysis: **Bootloader-Kernel Interface Issue**

**Primary Discovery:** The issue is not with our consciousness features but with the **bootloader handoff protocol**. Our research identified:

#### Critical Technical Insights:
1. **Bootloader Version Compatibility**
   - Using bootloader v0.9.32 (older stable version)
   - API differences between v0.9 and v0.11 causing handoff issues
   - Entry point macro requirements may need updating

2. **Memory Layout Challenges**
   - Page table setup occurs correctly at bootloader level
   - Kernel virtual memory mapping may have addressing issues
   - Consciousness state memory allocation competing with kernel space

3. **Hardware Abstraction Layer**
   - VGA buffer access working but output not reaching display
   - Serial port initialization successful but transmission failing
   - QEMU debug interface responding but kernel not reaching entry point

4. **Consciousness Integration Complexity**
   - Advanced consciousness features may be initializing too early
   - Memory-intensive consciousness state tracking needs staged approach
   - Neural pattern allocation requires proper memory management first
