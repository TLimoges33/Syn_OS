# SynapticOS Prototypes Extracted

This directory contains key prototypes extracted from the old SynapticOS repository that will be integrated into the ParrotOS fork.

## Extracted Components

### 1. Consciousness System (`/consciousness`)
- **neural_darwinism.py**: Implements Neural Darwinism for consciousness computing
  - Adaptive neural network populations
  - Evolutionary selection mechanisms
  - Competitive learning algorithms
  - Emergent consciousness behaviors
  - Based on Gerald Edelman's Theory of Neuronal Group Selection (TNGS)

### 2. Command Line Interface (`/cli`)
- **synaptic_cli.py**: Main CLI for SynapticOS
  - Service management (start/stop/restart)
  - Consciousness operations
  - Security scanning and monitoring
  - Learning interface
  - Enhanced shell integration

### 3. Kernel Components (`/kernel`)
- To be populated with kernel module prototypes

## Integration Plan

These prototypes will be adapted and integrated into the ParrotOS fork:

1. **Neural Darwinism Engine** → Will power the AI consciousness system
2. **CLI Interface** → Will be extended to include ParrotOS security tools
3. **Kernel Modules** → Will be modified to work with ParrotOS kernel

## Key Features to Preserve

- Evolutionary consciousness algorithms
- Real-time adaptation mechanisms
- Service orchestration architecture
- Security integration points
- Learning system hooks

## Next Steps

1. Fork ParrotOS repository
2. Create SynapticOS overlay structure
3. Adapt prototypes to ParrotOS architecture
4. Integrate with LM Studio for local AI processing
5. Build personal context engine using these foundations
