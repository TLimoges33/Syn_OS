# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Philosophy

Syn_OS is built with security as the foundation, not an afterthought. We follow a zero-trust architecture and implement defense-in-depth strategies throughout the system.

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Do NOT create public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

### Preferred Method
Send security reports to: **security@syn-os.org**

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if any)

### Response Timeline
- **24 hours**: Acknowledgment of report
- **72 hours**: Initial assessment and severity rating
- **7 days**: Detailed response and remediation plan
- **30 days**: Public disclosure (after fix is deployed)

## üîí Security Architecture

### Zero-Trust Principles
- **Never trust, always verify** - All requests authenticated and authorized
- **Least privilege access** - Minimal permissions for all components
- **Assume breach** - Continuous monitoring and rapid response
- **Encrypt everything** - Data at rest and in transit protected

### Security Layers

#### 1. Application Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Output encoding
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF tokens
- Secure session management

#### 2. Network Security
- mTLS for all communications
- Network segmentation
- Firewall rules (default deny)
- DDoS protection
- Rate limiting

#### 3. System Security
- Container security scanning
- Runtime protection
- File integrity monitoring
- Process monitoring
- Kernel-level security (eBPF)

#### 4. Data Security
- Encryption at rest (AES-256)
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3+)
- Key management (HSM)
- Data classification
- Secure deletion

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Security Scanning
- **SAST** (Static Application Security Testing)
- **DAST** (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
- **Dependency scanning** for known vulnerabilities
- **Container scanning** for base image vulnerabilities
- **Infrastructure scanning** for misconfigurations

### Manual Security Testing
- **Penetration testing** (quarterly)
- **Red team exercises** (bi-annually)
- **Code reviews** (all commits)
- **Architecture reviews** (design phase)

## üìã Security Requirements

### For Developers
All code contributions must:
- [ ] Pass security scans (zero high/critical findings)
- [ ] Include security tests
- [ ] Follow secure coding guidelines
- [ ] Be reviewed by security team member
- [ ] Include threat model analysis

### For Dependencies
All third-party dependencies must:
- [ ] Have no known high/critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Be from trusted sources
- [ ] Have active maintenance
- [ ] Pass license compliance checks
- [ ] Be pinned to specific versions

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Tools

### Development Tools
- **Static Analysis**: SonarQube, Semgrep
- **Dependency Scanning**: Snyk, OWASP Dependency Check
- **Secrets Detection**: GitLeaks, TruffleHog
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy, Clair

### Runtime Protection
- **RASP**: Runtime Application Self-Protection
- **WAF**: Web Application Firewall
- **SIEM**: Security Information and Event Management
- **IDS/IPS**: Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems

## üö¶ Security Incident Response

### Severity Levels

#### Critical (P0)
- Active exploitation in production
- Remote code execution
- Data breach or exposure
- **Response Time**: Immediate (< 1 hour)

#### High (P1)
- Potential for exploitation
- Privilege escalation
- Authentication bypass
- **Response Time**: 4 hours

#### Medium (P2)
- Requires user interaction
- Information disclosure
- DoS vulnerabilities
- **Response Time**: 24 hours

#### Low (P3)
- Minimal impact
- Requires specific conditions
- **Response Time**: 72 hours

### Response Process
1. **Identify** - Detect and analyze incident
2. **Contain** - Isolate affected systems
3. **Eradicate** - Remove threat and vulnerabilities
4. **Recover** - Restore services safely
5. **Learn** - Post-incident review and improvements

## üèÜ Security Certifications & Compliance

### Target Compliance
- **ISO 27001** - Information Security Management
- **SOC 2 Type II** - Security and availability
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** - Risk management
- **OWASP Top 10** - Web application security

### Security Metrics
- **Mean Time to Detection (MTTD)**: < 15 minutes
- **Mean Time to Response (MTTR)**: < 1 hour for critical
- **Vulnerability Patch Time**: < 24 hours for critical
- **Security Test Coverage**: > 95%

# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by opening a security issue or emailing the maintainers. We will respond promptly and coordinate a fix.

## Security Practices

- No secrets or credentials are stored in the repository.
- Automated security audits are run regularly (see scripts/a_plus_security_audit.py).
- All dependencies are reviewed for vulnerabilities.
- Branch protection and CI are enforced for all merges.

## Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will credit researchers who help keep Syn_OS secure.
