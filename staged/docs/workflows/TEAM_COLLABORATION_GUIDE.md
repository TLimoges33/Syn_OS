## ðŸš€ Team Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

We use a feature branch workflow with the following structure:

```
main (stable)
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/consciousness-kernel (Consciousness Team)
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/security-framework (Security Team) 
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/education-platform (Education Team)
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/performance-optimization (Performance Team)
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/enterprise-integration (Enterprise Team)
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/quantum-computing (Quantum Team)
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/documentation-system (Documentation Team)
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/testing-framework (QA Team)
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/iso-building (Build Team)
â””â”€â”€ feature/monitoring-observability (DevOps Team)
```

### Development Process

1. **Feature Development**
   - Work in your team's feature branch
   - Follow established patterns and frameworks
   - Write comprehensive tests
   - Update documentation

2. **Quality Assurance**
   - Run full test suite before commits
   - Follow code review process
   - Ensure security and performance standards
   - Validate documentation completeness

3. **Integration Process**
   - Submit PRs from feature branches to main
   - Peer review by other team members
   - Automated testing and validation
   - Merge after approval and testing

### Communication

#### Daily Standups
- **When:** Daily, flexible timing
- **Format:** Async updates in GitHub discussions
- **Content:** Progress, blockers, collaboration needs

#### Weekly Reviews
- **When:** Weekly team sync
- **Format:** Feature branch status review
- **Content:** Milestone progress, inter-team coordination

#### Monthly Planning
- **When:** Monthly planning session
- **Format:** Roadmap and priority review
- **Content:** Feature priorities, resource allocation

### Code Quality Standards

#### Error Handling
- Use established error handling patterns in `src/error_handling/`
- Implement proper logging with structured JSON format
- Handle edge cases and failure scenarios
- Follow severity levels: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, INFO

#### Testing Requirements
- Minimum 95% test coverage for new code
- Include unit, integration, and edge case tests
- Use test framework in `tests/` directory
- Run `python3 tests/run_tests.py` before commits

#### Documentation Standards
- Update relevant documentation for changes
- Include inline code comments for complex logic
- Create user-facing documentation for new features
- Follow markdown linting standards

### Collaboration Tools

#### GitHub Features
- **Issues:** Track bugs, features, and tasks
- **Pull Requests:** Code review and collaboration
- **Discussions:** Team communication and planning
- **Projects:** Milestone and sprint tracking

#### Local Development
- **Testing:** `python3 tests/run_tests.py --category all`
- **Linting:** `python3 scripts/lint-documentation.py`
- **Building:** `make build` or equivalent
- **Status:** `python3 check_repo_connection.py`

### Inter-Team Dependencies

#### High-Priority Dependencies
- **Consciousness â†” Security:** Neural security validation
- **Performance â†” Security:** Optimized cryptographic operations
- **Education â†” Documentation:** Learning material creation
- **Enterprise â†” Security:** Business security requirements

#### Coordination Process
1. **Dependency Identification:** Document in branch README
2. **Communication:** Use GitHub discussions for coordination
3. **Integration Planning:** Coordinate merge timing
4. **Testing:** Cross-team integration testing

### Conflict Resolution

#### Technical Conflicts
1. **Discussion:** GitHub discussions or PR comments
2. **Architecture Review:** Consult technical leads
3. **Prototype:** Create proof-of-concept if needed
4. **Decision:** Document decision and rationale

#### Process Conflicts
1. **Team Discussion:** Address in team sync
2. **Workflow Adjustment:** Update collaboration guide
3. **Documentation:** Update process documentation
4. **Review:** Evaluate effectiveness in retrospectives
