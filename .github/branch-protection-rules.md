```yaml
Branch: main
Protection Rules:
  - Require pull request reviews before merging: ✅
  - Required approving reviews: 1 (TLimoges33)
  - Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed: ✅
  - Require review from code owners: ✅
  - Require status checks to pass before merging: ✅
  - Require conversation resolution before merging: ✅
  - Require linear history: ✅
  - Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB: ✅
  - Allow force pushes: ❌
  - Allow deletions: ❌
```

#### **Master Branch Protection**
```yaml
Branch: master  
Protection Rules:
  - Require pull request reviews before merging: ✅
  - Required approving reviews: 1 (TLimoges33)
  - Require status checks to pass before merging: ✅
  - Require conversation resolution before merging: ✅
  - Allow force pushes: ❌ (TLimoges33 only)
  - Allow deletions: ❌
```

### **Development Repository (`TLimoges33/Syn_OS-Dev-Team`)**

#### **Main Branch Protection**
```yaml
Branch: main
Protection Rules:
  - Require pull request reviews before merging: ✅
  - Required approving reviews: 1
  - Require status checks to pass before merging: ✅
  - Require conversation resolution before merging: ✅
  - Allow force pushes: ❌
  - Allow deletions: ❌
```

## 🔧 Status Checks Required

### **Continuous Integration Checks**
- ✅ Rust compilation (kernel + security modules)
- ✅ Security audit (`cargo audit`)
- ✅ Code formatting (`cargo fmt --check`)
- ✅ Linting (`cargo clippy`)
- ✅ Test suite (`cargo test`)

### **Security Checks**
- ✅ Dependency vulnerability scan
- ✅ Code security analysis
- ✅ ISO build verification

## 🎯 Implementation Commands

### **For Production Repository:**
```bash
# Navigate to GitHub Repository Settings > Branches
# Click "Add rule" for main branch
# Apply protection rules as specified above
```

### **For Dev-Team Repository:**
```bash
# Navigate to GitHub Repository Settings > Branches  
# Click "Add rule" for main branch
# Apply protection rules as specified above
```

## 📝 Notes
- Branch protection rules must be configured through GitHub web interface
- Status checks will be automatically enforced once GitHub Actions are configured
- These rules ensure professional code quality and security standards
